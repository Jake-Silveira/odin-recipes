            <li style="font-size: larger;">Do not let that cop pull you over on your way back home. *</li>
            <li>Head out back to your candy garden and look for the stem with the tag "Nerds."</li>
            <li>Relentlessly pull the whole stem out and shake the nerds into a bowl.</li>
            <li>Head back to the kitchen and slam your pint of icream into a fresh bowl.</li>
            <li>Dump all of the Nerds candy ontop.</li>
            <li><b><u>DEVOUR THE GOODNESS.</u></b></li>
        </ol><br>
