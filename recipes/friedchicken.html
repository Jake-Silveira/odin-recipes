    <h3>Ingredients</h3><br>

        <ul> 
            <li> Chicken Breast Tenderloins</li>
            <li>Italian Seasoned Breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Vegetable Oil</li>
            <li>Personal Choice of Seasonings<i> (I prefer Garlic and Herb)</i></li>
            <li>Lemon or Lemon Juice (optional)</li>
        </ul><br>

    <h4>Steps</h4><br>
        <ol>
            <li>Clean your chicken tenderloinds by running them under water and dabbing them dry with a paper towel.</li>
            <li>Prep the 3 bowls you will be dipping your chicken into as follows: 
                <ul> 
                    <li>Flour w/ Seasonings</li>
                    <li>1-2 Eggs</li>
                    <li>Breadcrumbs w/ Seasonings</li>
                </ul> </li>
            <li>Dip the chicken into the bowls as they are ordered above, shaking off excess flour, egg, and breadcrumbs.<br><i>Note:It is best to use a "pressing" method when covering the chicken in breadcrumbs.</i></li>
            <li>Allow the breadcrumbs to soak up moisture from the chicken by letting it sit in the fridge for 10-15 minutes.</li> 
            <li>While your chicken is in the fridge:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Prep your cooking station by placing a pan onto the stove and allowing it to warm up.</li>
                    <li>Once the pan is warm, add enough Vegetable Oil to fully cover the bottom of the pan and allow it to warm up.</li>
                </ul></li>   
            <li>Now that your chicken has sat for 10-15 minutes and your cooking station is ready, place the chicken into the oil.</li>
            <li>Allow the breadcrumbs to become golden brown in color on the bottom, and then flip to repeat.</li>
            <li>Once your tenders are golden brown, <b>You're done!</b></li>
            <li>Remove them from the pan, allow them to drip excess oil onto a paper-towel and serve with your favorite sauce and side!</li>
            <li><b>ENJOY!</b></li>
        </ol>
